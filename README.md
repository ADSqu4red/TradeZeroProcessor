Consume a CSV file of transactions and match trades

The intent of this project is to match transactions into trades to help the user make his/her own trading journal in excel.

Consume the CSV File form your TradeZero Client Portal/Account Overview/Trades, and the project will generate an excel file in temp: "C:\temp\trades.xlsx"

HOW TO RUN:
The project contains a Console app. Just put the csv file location and run the console app. It will match the trades and output the data into the excel file!

Contributions are welcome!
